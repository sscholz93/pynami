## Documentation
Documentation of this package is available at [ReadtheDocs](https://pynami.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This also covers a lot of the NAMI API.
General documenation for the NAMI API is very few and partially outdated at [DPSG Confluence](https://doku.dpsg.de/display/NAMI/API).
You can also check the NAMI community forums at https://ncm.dpsg.de/.
